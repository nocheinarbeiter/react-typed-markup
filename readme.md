# react-typed-markup

This helper module is used by a code 
produced by [`gulp-typed-markup`](https://github.com/nocheinarbeiter/gulp-typed-markup) generator.

Due to major changes in internal structure of `React` type declarations,
there are special versions for each one: 
* `v1.x` for `@types/react@15.0.28`
* `v2.x` for `@types/react@16.0.1`

## Development
Run `npm run build` to compose and compile sources.
